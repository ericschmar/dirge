## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-04

### Security
- **Plugin tools now route through the permission engine.** A Janet
  plugin-registered tool previously ran its handler with **no**
  allow/deny/ask check — arbitrary file/network/shell I/O bypassing
  authorization entirely. Plugin tools now go through the same `enforce`
  chokepoint as built-ins via a new high-risk `Operation::Plugin` (not
  builtin-allowed, not Accept-coerced, like MCP/bash): they prompt by
  default in standard mode, can be denied with `deny_tools`, and are
  allowed under yolo or a `/allow plugin_tool …` grant.

### Added
- **Agent profiles** (opt-in): `/agent <name>` activates a named persona
  that bundles a system prompt, a model, and a tool policy
  (`.dirge/agents/*.md`, `~/.config/dirge/agents/*.md`, or config `agents`,
  layered project > global > config). `/agent off` reverts. The `task` tool
  can spawn a subagent under a profile via `task(agent="<name>")`. See
  [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md).
- **Shell integration** (the `:` prefix, zsh): an optional plugin to run
  `:<prompt>` from your normal shell — the answer prints and you stay in the
  shell; `:` commands share one session. See
  [shell-plugin/README.md](shell-plugin/README.md).
- **`--session <id>`**: resumes the session with that id if it exists, and
  **creates it under that exact id** otherwise — a stable id for scripts and
  the shell plugin.
- **`--no-color`**: collapses the entire TUI to the terminal's default
  foreground through a single theme chokepoint.
- **`Alt+X`**: drops queued mid-execution interjections without cancelling
  the running agent (`Ctrl+C` still cancels both).
- Role-routing keys `summarization_provider` and `subagent_provider` are now
  actually consumed: the former routes the in-loop compaction summarizer, the
  latter sets the default model for `task`-spawned subagents.

### Changed
- **Automatic compaction now runs LLM summarization.** Proactive
  turn-boundary folds at the high context-ratio threshold now produce a
  structured summary (via `summarization_provider` when configured, else the
  main model) instead of silently degrading to a prune-only pass — the
  in-loop summarizer was declared but never wired. The cheap tool-output
  cap/prune still runs first with no LLM call.
- **`/wt-merge` is now programmatic and conflict-safe.** It performs the
  merge directly (refuses on a dirty tree, `git merge --abort` on conflict,
  never force-deletes the worktree) instead of delegating to an unconstrained
  LLM prompt, and only returns to the main repo on a clean merge.
- **`/prompt` and `/agent` compose as independent layers.** Their
  `deny_tools` now union (an agent can no longer silently re-enable a tool an
  active prompt denied), and `/agent off` restores the prompt layer's prompt +
  denies and the pre-agent model.
- **`allow_tools` now caps MCP and plugin tools too** (via the `mcp_tool` /
  `plugin_tool` umbrellas), not just built-ins.
- **Phased `/plan`**: the plan phase now gets a true context reset
  (findings-only), matching its documented isolation; explore→plan forks run
  off the UI event loop.
- Model-family steering now tracks the active (swapped) model rather than the
  launch-time model, so `/model` and `/agent` swaps steer correctly.

### Fixed
- Compaction could leave an orphaned `tool_use`/`tool_result` pair
  (unbalanced history → provider 400); the fold window now snaps to
  user-message boundaries, and the tool-output prune handles block-array
  content (previously a silent no-op on real tool results).
- `edit_minified` is now classified as a mutating edit, so the
  verify-before-done gate and the repeat-loop/storm breaker treat it like
  `edit`/`apply_patch`.
- `--no-color` no longer leaks hard-coded green/red diff backgrounds.
- `/panel auto` threshold corrected to ≥152 cols (was documented as ≥100,
  where no gutter actually fits).
- The active DAP debug session is now torn down at process exit instead of
  relying on `Drop` of a `static` that never runs.
- Plugin `transform-context` / `on-compact` hooks no longer block a runtime
  worker thread (now `spawn_blocking` + timeout), and `message-end` fires in
  headless (`--print` / `--loop`) mode too.
- Background-shell concurrency cap is enforced atomically; `/mode yolo` warns
  at runtime when configured deny rules are made inert; `/allow add`
  validates against the single tool-name source of truth; a leaked git
  worktree is cleaned up if creation fails after `git worktree add`; an
  ignored plugin-provider re-registration is now surfaced.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) integration**: step-through debugging
  alongside the existing LSP client, hardened against the usual adapter
  failure modes (UB, hangs, panics).
- **Configurable terminal background**: themes can set a `background` color,
  and the built-in phosphor theme defaults to a soft charcoal `#222222`. The
  plain theme keeps the terminal's own background (`Reset`).
- **Snap-to-bottom on input**: typing in the prompt or pressing Down on a
  scrolled-up chat jumps straight back to the latest output instead of
  requiring a manual scroll.
- **Phased plan workflow** (`/plan <request>`, opt-in via
  `phased_workflow_enabled`): an explicit per-task command that runs
  explore → plan → implement → reviewer-runs-code loop. The explore and
  plan phases are context-isolated read-only forks; the implement phase
  is a normal streamed turn; a write-disabled reviewer fork then runs the
  code and emits a machine-parsed verdict, with `NEEDS_FIX` feeding a
  punch-list back for a bounded re-implement (`phased_workflow_max_review_cycles`,
  default 2). Ported from [vix](https://github.com/kirby88/vix). See
  [docs/agent-loop.md](docs/agent-loop.md#phased-plan-workflow-plan).
- **Minified tree-sitter read/edit** (`read_minified` / `edit_minified`):
  token-efficient file I/O that collapses a file to its structural
  skeleton — aggressive collapse for Rust/Java/Go, gap-preserving collapse
  for whitespace/ASI-sensitive grammars (Bash, Python, Ruby, Elixir, C/C++,
  TS, Clojure). Each gated on its `semantic-<lang>` feature.
- **Hard read-before-edit gate**: `edit`/`apply_patch` to a file never
  read this session is refused mechanically.
- **Thinking-stall watchdog**: the request-timeout backstop now injects a
  summary-reinjection nudge for graceful recovery from a stalled run.
- **Mandatory reason/intent fields** on the read/grep/glob/find/lsp tools
  (and bash anti-misuse fields), plus a **todo-completion nudge** that
  blocks a premature `end_turn` while todo items remain pending.
- Config keys `phased_workflow_enabled`, `phased_workflow_max_review_cycles`,
  and documentation for the pre-existing `dynamic_tool_search` and
  `context_depth_reminder_threshold` keys.

### Fixed
- **/plan busy indicator**: `/plan` now shows the standard busy state and
  clears the submitted text from the input box while the explore/plan forks
  run (previously it looked idle with the command still lingering), and the
  busy flag can no longer be stranded "running" by a failed repaint.
- **Resize scroll clamp**: enlarging the terminal while scrolled up no longer
  leaves a stale scroll offset that hid the newest output behind blank rows.
- **Idle Ctrl+C** now clears a typed-but-unsent draft instead of quitting
  outright; only an empty input line exits.
- **Home/End** moved to **Ctrl+Home/End** for chat scroll, freeing bare
  Home/End for the input editor's line-start/line-end as documented.
- Ctrl+J inside reverse-i-search no longer desyncs the search buffer.

### Acknowledgements
- Added [vix](https://github.com/kirby88/vix) — the battle-tested Go coding
  agent the above agentic-loop features were ported from.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- Unified permission/authorization engine (single Policy Decision Point):
  op-based rules, `/why` decision-trace command, atomic multi-claim bash.
- Input box scrolls to keep the cursor visible past the height cap, and
  Up/Down navigate across soft-wrapped display rows.
- Cohesive low-saturation phosphor palette (hue = action, brightness =
  importance), a dedicated soft "thinking" color, and syntax-highlighted
  `read` boxes. Critic/thinking colors are config-themeable.
- Config-driven plugin toggles (`plugins.<name>.{enabled, auto_start}`)
  and a bundled `backpressured` validation-gated loop plugin.

### Changed
- Lighter terminal UI: the heavy double-line frame is now light
  single-line/rounded, the side panels follow the main frame's theme
  color, and the input prompt is a simple `> `.
- Reasoning/thinking is suppressed by default (spinner + Ctrl+O to
  expand) to keep the conversation focused.

### Fixed
- Secrets in tool output are redacted before reaching the LLM / session
  transcript.
- Transient LLM connection failures ("error sending request") now retry
  with exponential backoff.
- Questionnaire custom answers soft-wrap instead of running off-screen.
- Edit results collapse the appended LSP diagnostics into a one-line
  summary (Ctrl+O to expand); diagnostic floods are summarized and the
  per-file cap tightened, so an unsupported language server no longer
  floods the chat.
- A configured `deny` rule is now terminal above a session allowlist.
- Resumed sessions keep persisting after a save (loaded-mtime refresh).

### Packaging
- Published to crates.io as the **`dirge-agent`** crate (the short
  `dirge` name was taken); the installed binary is still `dirge`:
  `cargo install dirge-agent`.

## [1.0.0]
