//! Phase 3 (P3e): the runtime glue that turns a forked phase runner into final
//! text. The phase *logic* (which prompt + tools each phase gets, the
//! explore→plan handoff, the reviewer-runs-code loop) lives in
//! [`crate::agent::plan_workflow`] and is unit-tested there without a runtime.
//!
//! This module supplies the missing half: [`collect_runner_text`] drains a
//! real [`AgentRunner`]'s event stream into the final `String`, and
//! [`review_once`] forks a write-disabled reviewer and turns its verdict into a
//! [`ReviewStep`]. It also defines the live `/plan` workflow state
//! ([`ActivePlan`] / [`PlanKickoff`]). The interactive entry is the `/plan`
//! slash command (`ui/slash/cmd_plan.rs`): it runs the explore→plan forks via
//! `collect_runner_text` + `agent.spawn_phase_runner(..)`, then the UI loop
//! launches the streamed implement run and `run_handlers/done.rs` drives the
//! reviewer loop with `review_once`.
