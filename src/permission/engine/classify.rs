//! Permission classification helpers.
//!
//! Pure functions for classifying tools (is this a path tool? is it
//! high-risk?) and building `Pattern` values with the right `*`
//! semantics for the tool category. Extracted from `checker.rs` so
//! they can be unit-tested independently of the `PermissionChecker`
//! struct's configuration wiring.
//!
//! Used by `checker.rs` (through thin delegating methods) and by
//! `allowlist.rs` (for `pattern_for_tool`).
