//! Shared ANSI / control-byte handling.
//!
//! Three things show up across the UI layer:
//!   1. Sanitizing text from untrusted producers (tool output, MCP
//!      server stderr, websearch results) before it reaches the
//!      chat buffer.
//!   2. Computing the visible width of strings that may embed SGR
//!      escapes (lives in `wrap::visible_width`).
//!   3. Building SGR colour sequences (lives in `markdown::ansi_fg`).
//!
//! Centralising (1) here means MCP / websearch / tool-output / chat
//! sanitization share one definition of "what's a control byte" —
//! previously each had its own filter, drifting in coverage (e.g.
//! one blocked C0 but not C1, another stripped `\r` but not C1
//! either).
//!
//! Threat model: a child process / search result / tool response
//! must not be able to steer the terminal (set color, move cursor,
//! disable mouse mode, switch alt screen, run OSC bell/notification,
//! emit DCS sequences). All known escape-introducer codepoints get
//! filtered:
//!   - C0 controls (U+0000..=U+001F) — including ESC (U+001B)
//!   - DEL (U+007F)
//!   - C1 controls (U+0080..=U+009F) — single-byte CSI / OSC / DCS
//!     in 8-bit terminals
//!
//! Newline and tab are SEPARATE knobs because some consumers want
//! to preserve them (chat markdown), others don't (chamber rows,
//! single-line banners).
