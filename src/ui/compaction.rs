//! Non-blocking compaction (dirge-tv3p / dirge-dtyn).
//!
//! Compaction's slow part is the summarizer LLM call. Running it inline in the
//! UI event loop froze rendering, input, and Ctrl+C for 10–60s. This module is
//! the off-thread half, mirroring the `/plan` phase machinery
//! ([`crate::agent::plan::runtime`]): the loop builds the prompt + resolves the
//! model on-thread ([`crate::ui::slash::prepare_compaction`]), [`spawn`]s the
//! summarizer as a task that streams a terminal event back, and a dedicated
//! `select!` arm installs the result on-thread
//! ([`crate::ui::slash::install_compaction`]) and runs the continuation.
//!
//! The session is loop-owned and is NOT touched while the task runs — the loop
//! gates new prompts/commands until the phase resolves — so the `cut_idx` /
//! `tokens_before` captured at prepare time are still valid at install.
